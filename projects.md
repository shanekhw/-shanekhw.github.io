## Samara Autorotating Wings (SAW)

The SAW project takes inspiration from the graceful falling of maple seeds, sometimes more fondly known as _helicopter seeds_. The main purpose of SAW platform is for precision aerial deployment of lightweight payloads at a relatively low-cost. It is ideal for applications such as precision reforestation projects, sensor deployments for remote sensing such as detection of natural disasters such as forest fires, flood, or monitoring of wild life, agriculture, gases and chemicals, weather detection and so on. This project has currently been explored in the following four focal points.

### Optimized Wing Planform

The size and shape of the wing affects how fast the platform rotates, how fast it drops, its pose and coning angle. 

### Collaborative Units and Mid-Air Separation

## Single Actuator Monocopter (SAM)

The idea to achieve controllable flight with a single actuator is one that is fancied by many and achieved by a few recently. SAM brings flight efficiency and dynamic stability of the craft to the table.

### Semi-rigid Foldable Wing Structure

Currently a work in progress. Details will be updated at a later stage.
