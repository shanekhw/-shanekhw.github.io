### Samara Autorotating Wings (SAW)

The SAW project takes inspiration from the graceful falling of maple seeds, sometimes more fondly known as _helicopter seeds_. This project has currently been explored in the following four focal points.

#### Optimized Wing Planform

#### Collaborative Units and Mid-Air Separation

#### Solar-cell Wings

#### Optimized Glide Slope and Diving Mode

### Single Actuator Monocopter (SAM)

The idea to achieve controllable flight with a single actuator is one that is fancied by many and achieved by a few recently. SAM brings flight efficiency and dynamic stability of the craft to the table.

#### Efficient 5-DOF Controllable Flight with Single Actuator

#### Semi-rigid Foldable Wing Structure
