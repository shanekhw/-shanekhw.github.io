## Samara Autorotating Wings (SAW)

The SAW project takes inspiration from the graceful falling of maple seeds, sometimes more fondly known as _helicopter seeds_. The main purpose of SAW platform is for precision aerial deployment of lightweight payloads at a relatively low-cost. It is ideal for applications such as precision reforestation projects, sensor deployments for remote sensing such as detection of natural disasters such as forest fires, flood, or monitoring of wild life, agriculture, gases and chemicals, weather detection and so on. This project has currently been explored in the following four focal points.

### Optimized Wing Planform

### Solar-cell Wings



### Optimized Glide Slope and Diving Mode

## Single Actuator Monocopter (SAM)

The idea to achieve controllable flight with a single actuator is one that is fancied by many and achieved by a few recently. SAM brings flight efficiency and dynamic stability of the craft to the table.

### Efficient 5-DOF Controllable Flight with Single Actuator

### Semi-rigid Foldable Wing Structure
